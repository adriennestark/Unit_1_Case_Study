# Ellevest Case Study

## Origin and Overview

- Name of company: Ellevest
- When was the company incorporated? Founded in 2014 
- Who are the founders of the company? Sallie Krawcheck and Charlie Kroll
- How did the idea for the company come about? Sallie Krawcheck was inspired to start a wealth-management company with women investors as its focus when she realized that women were not being optimally served by the existing wealth management firms that had been founded by men with men in mind. (source: https://support.ellevest.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016869254-How-was-Ellevest-started-)
- How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? Ellevest has had three rounds of funding raising a total of $77.6MM (source: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ellevest/company_financials)

## Business Activities
 - What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve? Ellevest is committing to closing the gender wealth gap. In the United States, for every $1 of wealth owned by men, women own $.32 and this gap is exacerbated for Black and Latinx women. (source: https://hbr.org/2019/10/closing-the-gender-wealth-gap)
 - Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? The company targets women investors and it appears that most of their social media marketing is targeting millennial women (there are 75 million millennials in US so we approximate 38 million millennial women). However, the website is quick to point out that while its mission is to close the wealth gap, any customer seeking money coaching or wealth management is welcome. 
- What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) Ellevest looks a lot like a lot of other roboadvisors, but it offers banking services, career coaching, and financial planning through its membership model. This sort of membership is unique among roboadvisors and it can lead to a greater share of wallet for the firm as clients can have their banking and investment management at one firm whereas most roboadvisors focus solely investment management.
- Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) Ellevest, like most roboadvisors, uses machine learning combined with modern portfolio theory to manage accounts. Something that is unique: the Ellevest algorithm also accounts for the gender wage gap and builds in that a woman may make less over her career.From Stackshare, I learned that Ruby is the programming language that they use (https://stackshare.io/ellevest/ellevest)
## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? Wealth Management

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? There has been a race to the bottom with cost in the broader wealth management industry. Automation through roboadvisors has driven the cost for wrap accounts down which has been a win for consumers and democratized managed accounts for broader usership. There has also been a move towards passive management (index funds) versus more actively managed funds (taking bets on specific companies or sectors.) 

* What are the other major companies in this domain? Ellevest has a unique offering as far as its membership model, but its main competitors in the robo space can be split into two categories: start-up robo companies and legacy wealth-management companies that have built a roboadvisor. The start-up category includes Betterment and Wealthfront. The latter category includes Fidelity's FidelityGo, Vanguard's Digital Advisor and Merrill Lynch's Merrill Edge.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? Ellevest has $100MM (as of March 2019, more recent data not found) in assets under management. In June they launched their membership model and have continued to hire employees through the pandemic.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? Hard  metrics for roboadvisors include assets under management, share of wallet, and performance versus benchmark. For a mission-based company such as Ellevest, other metrics such as diversity of leadership, helping more women meet their financial goals, and impact investing which means using the money that one invests to positively impact society. For its mission metrics, Ellevest and its CEO are vocal about both gender and racial equality. For one of the smaller players in the space, it is certainly one of the most vocal as far as financial feminism. Notably, during the Black Lives Matters protests in early June, the CEO called herself out for the diversity of her leadership team and renewed her commitment to ensuring that all women's voices are at the table. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? While Ellevest entered the roboadvisor space late compared to Betterment and Wealthfront (2014 vs 2008,) it continues to lag its competitors in assets under management. Metrics like share of wallet and performance versus benchmark are difficult to find, but it appears that as far as performance goes they are slightly above average.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) If I were consulting with Ellevest, I would suggest that they consider going into the insurance business to deepen their saturation into their clients' financial lives. I would also urge them to offer a debt ranking to help its clients make smart decisions about paying off their debt while creating a game-like system to motivate clients on their financial journey.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? Offering insurance would boost Ellevest's share of wallet and deepen client relationships. A debt ranking service would not only encourage Ellevest's clients, but could also benefit Ellevest's bottom line through driving its clients to free-up cashflow that could then be invested into its managed account platform.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? A debt-ranking system would use machine learning to make decisions about which debt to pay next.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? Machine learning and algorthms would make the decisions about how to most efficiently pay off debt.
