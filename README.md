Ellevest Case Study

# Ellevest Case Study

## Origin and Overview

- Ellevest
- Founded in 2014 by Sallie Krawcheck and Charlie Kroll
- Sallie Krawcheck was inspired to start a wealth-management company with women investors as its focus as she realized that women were not being optimally served by the existing wealth management firms that had been founded by men with men in mind.
- Ellevest has had three rounds of funding raising a total of $77.6MM (source: crunchbase.com)

## Business Activities
 - What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve? Ellvest is committing to closing the gender wealth gap. In the United States, for every $1 of wealth owned by men, women own $.32 and this gap is exacerbated for Black and Latinx women. (source: https://hbr.org/2019/10/closing-the-gender-wealth-gap)
 - Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? The company targets women investors and it appears that most of their social media marketing is targeting millennial women (there are 75 million millennials in US so we approximate 38 million millennial women). However, the website is quick to point out that while its mission is to close the wealth gap, any customer seeking money coaching or wealth management is welcome. 
- What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) Ellevest looks a lot like a lot of other robo-advisors, but it leverages the cost savings from robo portfolio management to offer personalized coaching through its membership program that ofers banking services, career coaching, and financial planning.
- Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? Wealth Management

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? There has been a race to the bottom with cost in the broader wealth management industry. Automation through robo advisors has driven the cost for wrap accounts down which has been a wine for consumers and democratized the managed accounts for broader consumership. There has also been a move towards passive management (index funds) versus more actively managed funds (taking bets on specific companies or sectors)

* What are the other major companies in this domain? Ellevest has a unique offering as far as its membership model, but its main competitors in the robo space can be split into two categories: start-up robo companies and legacy wealth-management companies that have built a robo advisor. The start-up category includes Betterment and Wealthfront. The latter category includes Fidelity's FidelityGo, Vanguard's Digital Advisor and Merrill Lynch's Merrill Edge.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) If I were consulting with Ellevest, I would suggest that they offer a debt ranking to help its clients make smart decisions about paying off their debt while creating a game-like system to motivate clients on their financial journey. I would also suggest that they consider going into the insurance business to deepen their saturation into their clients' financial lives. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? This service would not only encourage Ellevest's client, but could also benefit Ellevest's bottom line through driving its clients to free-up cashflow that could then be invested into its managed account platform.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
